Hi Friends,

I am aiming to get a job in the bioinformatics/computational biology field and I think that a good way to get the recruiters in confidence is if I have a slew of certificates in the field. I think that getting certificates is not the end-point but I should emphasize what the key-takeaways from the courses were. 

# 1) Genomic Data Science Specialization
- Offered by John Hopkins University
- Completed the first two courses
- Beginners level and introduces everything from scratch 
## 1.1) Introduction to Genomic Technologies
