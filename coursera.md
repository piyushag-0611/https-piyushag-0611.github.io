Hi Friends,

I am aiming to get a job in the bioinformatics/computational biology field and I think that a good way to get the recruiters in confidence is if I have a slew of certificates in the field. Note that I think that certificates are not really all but I can also just mention what the key-takeaways from the courses were. What the level of the course is and if one should bother putting in their time in there or not.
