My name is Piyush Agarwal. 
I am a third year undergrad at Department of Mathematics, IIT Bombay.
I will put up some tools to calculate a few stuff.
I want to put things related 

-calculating the Jacobian form of a matrix
-Legendre Symbol of an integer in Z_p
-Continued Fraction Representation of a real no.

Apart from that I wrote a lot during the lockdown, that would be up.
Things related to finance as well.
