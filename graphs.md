I took up a good course on graph theory, MA5109 this autumn semester 20-21.

I want to talk about a few things and more importantly write down code to implement the algorithms we 
studied. So this page will be all about that. 

Today, I tried out implementing graphs using adjacency list and checking whether the adjacency list truly represents 
a simple matrix or not.
