If my father was a poet and a morning walker, what he would have said to my mother.


Just like the faint striking and the gushing winds take away

All the burning discomforts making the heart cool and silent,

Your silent whispers and faint throbbing have made me

Overcome all of my limitations, forget all worries and surpass all pains.


Just like the silent flapping helps the pigeon

Fly high & above and even get down to rest,

The silence in your voice has allowed me both

Rise high with respect and to remain grounded & low.


Just like the sweet whistles and the humming vibrations

Fills the morning air with love and delight,

The melody in your affectionate voice fills me with

A deep soothing comfort.


With all these, blessed do I feel, even as you 

Stick with me through all my faults and ignorance.

Really ,To have a friend as you, To have a lover as you , 

& To have a wife as you, blessed do I feel.
