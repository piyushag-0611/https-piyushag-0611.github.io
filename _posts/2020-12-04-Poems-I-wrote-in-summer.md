If my father was a poet and a morning walker, what he would have said to my mother.


Just like the faint striking and the gushing winds take away<br/>
All the burning discomforts making the heart cool and silent,<br/>
Your silent whispers and faint throbbing have made me<br/>
Overcome all of my limitations, forget all worries and surpass all pains.<br/>


Just like the silent flapping helps the pigeon<br/>
Fly high & above and even get down to rest,<br/>
The silence in your voice has allowed me both<br/>
Rise high with respect and to remain grounded & low.


Just like the sweet whistles and the humming vibrations<br/>
Fills the morning air with love and delight,<br/>
The melody in your affectionate voice fills me with<br/>
A deep soothing comfort.


With all these, blessed do I feel, even as you <br/>
Stick with me through all my faults and ignorance.<br/>
Really ,To have a friend as you, To have a lover as you , <br/>
& To have a wife as you, blessed do I feel.
