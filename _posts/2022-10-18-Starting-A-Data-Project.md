I had quite a lesson today, and learnt some critical steps as to how to go about working in a data project. How should really approach these projects and keep things clear and hassle free. 

* Know your Data, now how do you know your data?
  * Spend a week on getting to know your data before starting any analysis
  * First step is know the source of your data. How was the data obtained, how is it measured, what do the different features represent. How much accurate your data is?
